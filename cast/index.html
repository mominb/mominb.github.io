Jaffrelot also believes the community to be related to the Kamboj community mainly in the northern India and eastern Pakistan.[4] Some scholars have linked Arains to the Rayeen, a Rajput caste of India.[5] Ishtiaq Ahmed, a political scientist that is also a member of the Arain community, acknowledges that some early Arain texts ascribe a Persian origin and others a Rajput descent. He says that the Arain claims of Arab descent could be viewed as a claim to status as "conquerors and original Muslims". He believes that the Arains "are a mix of many ethnicities and races", similar to other "farming castes of the Punjab and Haryana.')

Quraish are the descendants of Abraham through Ismail in Arabia. The Quraish at first opposed Muhammadâ€™s teachings and are said to have persecuted him and his followers, but by the time of his death they had begun to convert to the new faith and played an important role in bringing Arabia under the banner of Islam.")

Over subsequent centuries, descendants of these soldiers inter-married with Persian and Turkish Muslims, converted to Islam, and adopted the Persian language and culture. Conflict between India and the Mongols has been recorded from the time of Genghis Khan to Timur to Babur. The Delhi Sultanate (1206â€“1526) faced nearly annual Mongol onslaughts from 1297 to 1303 when the Doab was sacked, and what is now Pakistan was under continual Mongol occupation. Indian and Indo-Persian sources referred to the invaders as Mughal, derived from Mongol. During the 16th century, the Turko-Mongol conqueror Babur brought most of northern India under Mughal rule, establishing an empire that would endure until the mid-19th century. As the ruling class, the Mughals lived mainly in cities along with other Muslims. They were traditionally known for their skill at horsemanship, archery, wrestling, and a meat-heavy diet.[")
